# Mine-Footprint Change Analyzer (MFCA) - Technical Report

## I. Executive Summary

The Mine-Footprint Change Analyzer (MFCA) is a Python-based command-line tool designed to detect and quantify changes in mining activity over time using satellite imagery and geospatial data. The software successfully identifies mining expansion and intensification by comparing multi-temporal raster datasets and provides detailed per-polygon change statistics.

## II. Background and Functionality

### Software Purpose

**Mine-Footprint Change Analyzer (MFCA)** is a command-line software application designed to quantify change in mining-area extents over time. Given:
- A vector layer of mining-area polygons (GeoPackage or Shapefile, in EPSG:4326)
- Two single-band GeoTIFF rasters "before" and "after" dates (matched CRS & resolution)

MFCA will:
1. **Validate** inputs (CRS, resolution)
2. **Clip** polygons to a user-specified Area Of Interest (AOI) by ISO-3 code or bounding box
3. **Classify** each raster into binary "mined" vs. "not-mined" labels using a threshold (default = global mean, overridable)
4. **Detect** per-pixel change by differencing the two label rasters in memory-efficient windows
5. **Summarize** change within each polygon (total pixels, changed pixels, percent changed)
6. **Export** the results as `_change_summary.csv`

### Technical Challenges

The development process encountered several significant technical challenges:

- **Handling large global rasters** (e.g., 43,200 × 21,600) within limited RAM
- **Ensuring exact alignment** (CRS, pixel size) across inputs
- **Designing a streaming classifier and change-detector** to avoid out-of-memory errors
- **Geospatial Data Handling**: Managing large raster datasets with mixed coordinate systems and varying resolutions
- **No-Data Handling**: Dealing with sparse datasets where 98.5% of pixels contained no-data values
- **Threshold Selection**: Developing appropriate classification thresholds for different sensor types and mining contexts
- **Package Dependencies**: Managing complex geospatial library dependencies (GDAL, PROJ, GEOS)
