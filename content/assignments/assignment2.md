## 🎯 Objective

To set up, customize, and deploy a static personal blog website using Hugo. The
project integrates Git for version control and includes documentation of both
the deployment process and the integration of previous assignment work.

---

## 🛠 Framework and Tool Selection

- **Hugo**: Fast static site generator that supports Markdown and flexible theming.
- **Ananke**: A clean, mobile-friendly Hugo theme chosen for simplicity and responsiveness.
- **Git**: Used for version control to track progress and commits.
- **GitHub**: Hosted the source code and enabled automated deployment via GitHub Actions.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used for hosting the final website at a public URL.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Process

### 1. Initialized Hugo site

```bash
hugo new site blog-website

## 🧠 Git Commit Strategy

The following commits show meaningful project progression and were key to
building and deploying the blog successfully:

| Commit Message | Purpose / Contribution |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ `Initial commit - Hugo site setup` | Scaffolded the entire Hugo website
project — created config, folders, and structure. |
| ✅ `Fix Liquid syntax error in Assignment 1 report and update Hugo config` |
Fixed broken post formatting that was stopping content from rendering. |
| ✅ `Re-added Ananke theme for Hugo` | Reinstalled and configured the theme
correctly after previous build issues. |
| ✅ `Fix: Clean docs/public folders and add GitHub Actions workflow` | Set up
automated deployment using GitHub Actions for seamless updates. |
| ✅ `Add deployment process documentation` | Wrote the full deployment report
and integrated it into the site as a blog post. |

> These commits are clean, logical, and show hands-on version control,
debugging, and feature integration.
